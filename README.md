## Overview

MediFlow AI is a fully self-contained, single-file hospital intelligence web application. It simulates a real-world clinical decision support system that:

- Predicts **discharge times** for inpatients using EHR data patterns
- Forecasts **emergency admission surges** using 24-hour and 7-day ML models
- Ranks **outpatient (OP) patients by admission priority** using a multi-factor ML scoring engine
- Optimises **bed, ICU, and OR allocation** to cut wait times by 15% and push utilisation above 85%
- Stores all patient data **persistently in the browser's localStorage** — no server required
- Supports full **CSV import and export** of patient datasets

There is **no installation, no backend, no internet connection required**. Just open `index.html`.

---

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Unzip the downloaded file
unzip mediflow-ai-v2.zip

# 2. Open in browser
open mediflow-v2/index.html
# or double-click index.html in your file explorer
```

That's it. The app loads with **22 pre-seeded patients** (12 inpatients + 10 outpatients) and is immediately usable.

## OP Priority Scoring Algorithm

Each outpatient is scored out of **100 points** across six clinical domains. Higher score = more urgent = admit first.

```
Total Score = Vitals + Complaint + Comorbidities + Wait Time + Labs + Age Risk
```

### Factor Breakdown

| Factor | Max Points | Key Rules |
|---|---|---|
| **Vital Signs** | 25 | BP ≥180 or ≤90 (+8), HR ≥120 or ≤50 (+7), SpO₂ ≤90% (+7), extreme temp (+3) |
| **Chief Complaint** | 20 | Chest pain / cardiac / stroke / dyspnea / fitting (+18), abdominal pain / fever / headache (+10), other (+4) |
| **Comorbidities** | 20 | CAD/CHF (+6), COPD/Asthma (+4), Diabetes (+4), CKD (+4), Hypertension (+3), Anticoagulation (+3), Cancer (+5) — capped at 20 |
| **Wait Duration** | 15 | ≥6h (+15), ≥3h (+10), ≥1h (+6), <1h (+2) |
| **Lab Values** | 12 | Blood sugar ≥300 or ≤60 (+4), WBC ≥15 or ≤3 (+3), Hb ≤8 (+3), Creatinine ≥2.5 (+3) |
| **Age Risk** | 8 | Age ≥80 (+8), ≥70 (+6), ≥65 (+4), ≤5 yrs (+7), ≤12 yrs (+4) |

### Priority Tiers

| Tier | Score Range | Colour | Action |
|---|---|---|---|
| **P1 Critical** | 80–100 | 🔴 Red | Admit immediately |
| **P2 Urgent** | 60–79 | 🟠 Orange | Admit within 2 hours |
| **P3 Semi-urgent** | 40–59 | 🟡 Yellow | Admit same day |
| **P4 Routine** | 0–39 | 🟢 Green | Schedule next available slot |

> **Risk override:** If a patient's `risk` field is explicitly set to `critical` or `high`, the score is floored at 80 or 60 respectively, ensuring they are never under-ranked.

## Dataset Management

### Adding Patients

**Via the form (Dataset tab):**
Fill in the Quick Add Patient form. All vitals and lab fields are optional but improve scoring accuracy. The priority score is calculated automatically when you click **Add Patient**.

**Via CSV import:**
Drag a CSV file onto the drop zone or click to browse. The system will:
- Parse all rows using the column headers
- Calculate priority scores for each patient
- Upsert records (update if ID exists, add if new)
- Save to localStorage immediately

### Editing Patients
Click the **✏ Edit** button on any row in the Patients or Dataset page. After editing vitals or complaints, the priority score recalculates automatically on save.

### Deleting Patients
Click the **🗑 Delete** button on any row. You will be prompted to confirm. To remove all data, use **Clear All** in the Dataset tab.

### Recalculating Scores
Click **🔄 Recalculate Priority** on the OP Priority page to re-run the ML scoring algorithm on the entire dataset. This is useful after bulk CSV imports or manual edits.

## How localStorage Works

All patient data is stored in your browser's **localStorage** under the key `mediflow_patients_v3`.

```
localStorage["mediflow_patients_v3"] = JSON array of patient objects
```

- Data **persists** across page refreshes, browser restarts, and computer reboots
- Data is **browser and origin specific** — data in Chrome won't appear in Firefox
- Data is **private to your device** — nothing is sent to any server
- Typical localStorage limit is **5MB** — sufficient for several thousand patient records
- A **"✓ Saved"** indicator flashes in the top-right corner after every write operation
- To fully reset the app, click **Clear All** in the Dataset tab, or run `localStorage.removeItem('mediflow_patients_v3')` in the browser console

---

## Technology Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|---|---|
| **UI Framework** | Vanilla HTML5 / CSS3 / JavaScript (ES2020+) — no frameworks |
| **Charts** | HTML5 Canvas API — fully custom, no chart libraries |
| **Data Persistence** | Browser `localStorage` API |
| **Fonts** | Google Fonts — Fraunces (display), Outfit (UI), JetBrains Mono (data) |
| **ML / Scoring** | Rule-based weighted scoring engine (simulated ML) |
| **CSV Parsing** | Custom CSV parser (handles quoted fields with commas) |
| **Build Tools** | None — single static HTML file, no bundler required |
| **Dependencies** | None — fully self-contained |

---

## Folder Structure

```
mediflow-v2/
├── index.html        ← Entire application (HTML + CSS + JS in one file)
└── README.md         ← This file
```

All styles, scripts, and data are embedded in `index.html`. This design ensures:
- No CORS issues when opening as a local file
- No broken relative paths
- Easy distribution — just share the single file

---

## Known Limitations

- **localStorage is browser-bound** — data does not sync across devices or browsers. Use CSV export/import to transfer data.
- **ML scoring is rule-based** — the priority algorithm uses a weighted clinical ruleset, not a trained neural network. Scores are clinically informed approximations, not medical diagnoses.
- **Charts are static after page load** — charts render on tab switch. If you resize the browser window significantly, switch to another tab and back to redraw.
- **No user authentication** — this is a demonstration platform. Do not store real patient data in a browser application without appropriate security controls.
- **localStorage limit** — browsers typically cap localStorage at 5MB. For very large datasets (5,000+ patients), prefer CSV export and reimport subsets.
- **Offline only** — the app requires an internet connection only on first load to fetch Google Fonts. All other functionality works offline.
